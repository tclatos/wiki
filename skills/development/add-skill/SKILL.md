# Create a New Skill

Skills are SKILL.md files that give agents **procedural knowledge on demand**.
They are loaded progressively — agents read them when needed, not on every call.

## Quick Method (CLI)

```bash
cli skills create my-skill-name
# Then edit: skills/custom/my-skill-name/SKILL.md
```

## Manual Method

### Step 1: Create the directory

```bash
mkdir -p skills/custom/my-skill-name
```

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: One sentence — what this skill enables an agent to do.
tags: [tag1, tag2]
version: "1.0"
author: ""
---

# My Skill Name

## When to Use

Describe exactly when an agent should apply this skill. Be specific:
"Use this skill when the user asks to query the knowledge graph with Cypher."

## Workflow

1. First action — be imperative, not passive
2. Second action — include concrete examples (selectors, commands, URLs)
3. Third action — describe expected outcomes

## Code Map

| Concern | Path |
|---------|------|
| Main logic | `<package>/...` |
| Config | `config/...` |
| Tests | `tests/...` |

## Examples

```bash
# Concrete CLI example
cli agents run my_agent "use my-skill to do X"
```

## References

- Related skill: `skills/custom/related-skill/SKILL.md`
- genai-tk docs: `docs/EXTENDING.md`
```

### Step 3: Validate

```bash
cli skills validate my-skill-name
```

### Step 4: Wire to an agent profile

**Important:** skills are only honored at runtime by `harness: langchain,
type: deep` profiles and by any `harness: deerflow` profile — deepagents'
`SkillsMiddleware` reads and injects skill content for `type: deep`, and
DeerFlow's own runtime (`genai_tk/agents/deer_flow/config_bridge.py`) loads
`skills`/`skill_directories` independently, regardless of `mode`. A
`harness: langchain, type: react` (or `custom`) profile parses
`skill_directories` without error but never loads the skill into the model's
context — see `skills/genai-tk/agent-profiles/SKILL.md` for the full
comparison. If your skill must be available to the running agent (not just
to a human/Copilot developer), pick one of:

```yaml
# LangChain deep agent
agents:
  my_agent:
    harness: langchain
    type: deep
    skill_directories:
      - ${paths.project}/skills/custom

# DeerFlow agent (any mode)
agents:
  my_deerflow_agent:
    harness: deerflow
    mode: pro
    skills:
      - my-skill-name
    skill_directories:
      - ${paths.project}/skills/custom
```

## Format Rules (skills.sh compatible)

- **Frontmatter** (YAML between `---`) must have `name` and `description`
- **`## When to Use`** — tells the agent when to load this skill
- **`## Workflow`** — numbered steps, imperative voice
- **`## Code Map`** — table of paths the agent needs to navigate
- Keep total length under **300 lines** — shorter skills are loaded more reliably
- **No passive voice** — "Navigate to X", not "X should be navigated to"

## Sharing Your Skill

To share publicly via skills.sh:
1. Push to a GitHub repo as `<repo>/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Others install with: `cli skills add --skillssh your-org/your-repo`
3. Optionally register at https://www.skills.sh
