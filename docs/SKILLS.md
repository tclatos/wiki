# Skills Guide

Skills are SKILL.md files that give agents **procedural knowledge on demand**.
Instead of bloating every system prompt, agents read skills when they need specific capabilities.

This project uses the [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh) format — compatible with GitHub Copilot,
Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, and other AI coding agents.

## Quick Reference

```bash
cli skills list                              # show all installed skills
cli skills add deep-research                 # install a bundled skill
cli skills add --git <url> --path <subdir>   # install from git repo
cli skills add --skillssh langchain-ai/langchain-skills   # via skills.sh
cli skills create my-skill                   # scaffold a new skill
cli skills validate --all                    # lint all skills
cli skills info <name>                       # show metadata + content
```

## Skill Directory Layout

Skills follow a **4-tier architecture** with support for custom and community extensions:

```
skills/
├── runtime/             # Runtime capabilities solving user problems
│   └── browser-automation/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── development/         # Developer skills improving and extending the toolkit
│   └── benchmark-framework/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── governance/          # Governance, quality, testing, and consistency
│   └── evaluation-testing/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── vendor/              # Third-party / external skills (not edited directly)
│   └── atos-slidev/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── custom/              # Project-local custom skills
│   └── my-domain/
│       └── SKILL.md
└── community/           # Installed from git or skills.sh
    └── langchain-retrieval/
        └── SKILL.md
```

Tracked in `skills.yaml` at the project root.

## Writing a Skill

Use `cli skills create <name>` to scaffold, then edit the generated SKILL.md.

### Format (skills.sh compatible)

```markdown
---
name: my-skill-name
description: One sentence — what this skill enables an agent to do.
tags: [rag, langchain, search]
version: "1.0"
author: ""
---

# My Skill Name

## When to Use

Describe the scenario where an agent should apply this skill.
Be specific: "Use when the user asks to query the knowledge graph using Cypher."

## Workflow

1. Step one — what to do first
2. Step two — concrete action with example
3. Step three — how to handle the result

## Code Map

| Concern | Path |
|---------|------|
| Main logic | `wiki/...` |
| Config | `config/...` |

## References

- Link to relevant docs
- Link to related skill
```

### Best Practices

- **One skill, one domain** — focused skills are read more reliably than broad ones
- **Be imperative** — "Navigate to...", "Call...", not "You might want to..."
- **Include concrete examples** — selectors, query patterns, CLI invocations
- **Code Map section** — tells the agent where to look in the codebase
- **≤300 lines** — shorter is loaded more reliably; split large skills

## Community Skills

### skills.sh Registry

[skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh) is an open registry of reusable agent skills:

```bash
# Install from skills.sh (requires Node.js / npx)
cli skills add --skillssh langchain-ai/langchain-skills

# Or use npx directly
npx skills add langchain-ai/langchain-skills

# Browse topics
# https://www.skills.sh/topic/agent-workflows
```

### LangChain Official Skills

[langchain-ai/langchain-skills](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-skills) is the
official LangChain skill collection. Recommended installs:

```bash
# Full collection
cli skills add --skillssh langchain-ai/langchain-skills

# Specific skill via git
cli skills add --git https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-skills --path retrieval
cli skills add --git https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-skills --path agents
```

### Installing from Any Git Repo

Skills can live anywhere in a git repo — just point to the directory containing SKILL.md:

```bash
# Entire repo is a single skill
cli skills add --git https://github.com/my-org/my-skill

# Skill is in a subdirectory
cli skills add --git https://github.com/my-org/skills-monorepo --path rag/retrieval

# Pin to a specific version
cli skills add --git https://github.com/my-org/my-skill --ref v1.2.0
```

The installed skill is recorded in `skills.yaml` with the git SHA for reproducibility.

## Wiring Skills to Agents

In your unified agent profile config (`config/agents.yaml`):

```yaml
agents:
  my_agent:
    harness: langchain
    name: "My Agent"
    type: deep
    llm: default
    skill_directories:
      - ${paths.project}/skills/custom
      - ${paths.project}/skills/community
```

For DeerFlow profiles (same file, `harness: deerflow`):

```yaml
agents:
  "Research Agent":
    harness: deerflow
    skill_directories:
      - ${paths.project}/skills/custom
    available_skills:
      - my-domain  # optional filter; omit to expose all
```

## Sharing Your Skills

To share a skill publicly via skills.sh:

1. Create a GitHub repo with your skills in subdirectories:
   ```
   my-skills/
   └── my-skill-name/
       └── SKILL.md
   ```
2. Push to GitHub
3. Others can install with:
   ```bash
   cli skills add --skillssh your-org/my-skills
   npx skills add your-org/my-skills
   ```

Add a badge to your README:
```markdown
[![skills.sh](https://skills.sh/b/your-org/my-skills)](https://skills.sh/your-org/my-skills)
```
