# Getting Started with Wiki

## Overview

This project uses genai-tk for AI agent capabilities. This skill gives agents an
overview of the project's tools and capabilities.

## Available Tools

- **example_calculator** — evaluate arithmetic expressions
- Add your own in `wiki/tools/`

## Available Agent Profiles

Run `cli agents list` to see configured profiles.

## Workflow

1. Check `config/agents.yaml` for available profiles
2. Use `cli agents run <profile> --chat` to start a session
3. Tools are automatically available based on the profile configuration

## Adding New Capabilities

See `docs/EXTENDING.md` for how to add tools, commands, and agent profiles.
